# How to build

## Before we begin
Original SweetAlert2 doesn't give you any build insctructions. Although, it's easy to build SweetAlert, I will still include instructions.

## Requirements
OS: Any linux distro that can run Node.js version 16 or above
Yarn: 1.12.19 or above
Node.js: v16 or above

## Commands
1. `git clone https://github.com/MrCheatEugene/sweetalert2-RU`
2. `cd sweetalert2-RU`
3. `yarn install`
4. `yarn add zx`
5. `yarn run build`

Done! Built JS/CSS are located in ./dist folder. You can do what you want with them now!
